This is an app for natural disasters. It consists of 3 stages. This is the first one. It is used more like a city guide in order to get familiar with and use it before the disaster occurs. It can also present actions connected with preventing a natural  disaster like cleaning a forest.

It is offered as it is. People who chose to use it they are doing it at their own risk
